 * Generates a slow but working Q/E clock signal for the MC6809E CPU.  Designed
 * for an ATtiny13A running at 9.6MHz, which is able to put out a 285kHz signal
 * with Q on PB3 and E on PB4, nowhere near the 1MHz capability of the slowest
 * '09, but good enough to build a circuit with it. TODO: can PWM do a better
 * job?
 *
 * Part of the 8821 Project: http://www.sowbug.com/tagged/8821
 *
 * Using fuse calculator from http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/, determined
 * that the right avrdude magic for the internal 9.6MHz clock with SUT 14+64
 * was...
 *
 * -U lfuse:w:0x7a:m -U hfuse:w:0xff:m
